# CSC_MCE_Part1
Building an algorithm to interpret course grades into a semester final grade.









'what input can it take in'
	The input that our code will take in is a name and the data that the user wants to see. The data could be the number grade, letter grade or midterm grade or categorical grade. For example, if the user enters the name “Chris”, and the data the user wants is the number grade. The user would enter the name first and the choice they want to see. The program will first tell the user to enter a name and then show a list of each choice which is 1,2,3,4,5. Choice 1 is final grade, Choice 2, letter grade, choice 3 midterm grade, choice 4 is categorical grade and choice 5 would exit the program. For example, the user enters the name “Chris” and then the user enters choice 1. The program will call calculateFinalGrade() function and use the hard coded dataset for that name and calculate the final grade for that person. We also wanted to implement an exception handling block of code that would break until the user enters the right name/s. For example, if the user enters “Anna” , the program would not break unless the user enters one of the names in the dataset.
